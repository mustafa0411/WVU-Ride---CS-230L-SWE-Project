WVURide is a student created carpool service to connect students seeking reliable rides to and from class, gatherings, and other events. Students can post their ride scenarios and toggle a flag for sharing gas to create incentive for other student drivers. Students can also search through the posts by location to determine if there's a good match for them!

We used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS when constructing this application. We ran testing through Unit Testing, SonarQube, and Selenium. 

To run our project simply downlload the file contents and open in VSCode. Typing npm start into the terminal after navigating to the client directory will get WVURide up and running for you to test!
